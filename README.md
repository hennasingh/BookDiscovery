# BookDiscovery
Book Listing App. This is 7th project in Android Scholarship Program. The goal is to design and create the structure of a Book Listing app which would allow a user to get a list of published books on a given topic. I have used google books api in order to fetch results and display them to the user.

A gif is as below
